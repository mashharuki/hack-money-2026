# Demo Day "Happy Path" Checklist

**Goal**: Don't let the demo crash during the recording or judge review.

## 1. Pre-Recording Prep
- [ ] **Clean State**: Create a fresh wallet address. Old test txs can look messy.
- [ ] **Zoom In**: Set browser zoom to 125% or 150%. Text must be readable on a phone screen.
- [ ] **Notifications Off**: Turn off Mac "Do Not Disturb". No Telegram popups.
- [ ] **Data Prep**: If your app needs "Market Data", hardcode a "Good" scenario. Don't rely on live API calls if they are flaky.

## 2. The "Happy Path" Walkthrough
- [ ] **Step 1**: Connect Wallet (Ensure it connects instantly).
- [ ] **Step 2**: Perform the *Main Action* (The thing that uses the Sponsor Tech).
    - *Tip*: If the transaction takes 30s, cut the video or speed it up. Don't make judges watch a loading spinner.
- [ ] **Step 3**: Show the Success State (Confetti, Balance Update).
- [ ] **Step 4**: Show the Explorer Link (Proof it's on-chain).

## 3. Submission Data
- [ ] **Github**: Is the repo Public?
- [ ] **Contract Verification**: Are the contracts verified on the block explorer? (Judges check this).
- [ ] **Links**: Double check the Demo URL in the dashboard.
